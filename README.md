### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, The difficulty I faced was in applying the overlay color on an image to which I found the solution of adding opacity to the image

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.image {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: 200px;
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
}

.card-image {
  object-fit: fill;
  opacity: 0.5;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue my focus on responsive webdesign. As It is a quite challenging topic for me.
